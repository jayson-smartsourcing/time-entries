6/3/2019 2:58:34,cleo.v@startsmartsourcing.com,5,"Positive points:
1) Work-life balance
2) Free lunch
3) Management tries to listen to employee suggestions
4) Generosity on events & freebies in kind (e.g. Christmas kit, budget on events, etc.)

Points for improvement:
1) Employment contract & nature of job should be clearer to applicants - what is reflected in my contract is not the nature of the work I am doing. It is best to be clear about the job offered to applicants for better matching of skill & role. 

2) Hiring process - refrain from having applicants go back and forth to and from the office (maximum 3 visits or less if possible); It would also be more efficient if contract & kit is ready upon arrival of new employee since this is usually scheduled.

3) Clearer Instructions & proper introduction to tools, other rules in employee handbook for new hires -  I was only introduced to the project plan after 3 months I was working in Smartsourcing, & was already expected me to have an in depth knowledge of this & was asked to update this ASAP. This could have been more efficient if introduced to me & properly turned over during my 1st month in SmartSourcing. 

Further only basic rules in the handbook are introduced to new hires. An updated copy of the handbook should be given to all employees.

4) Management/Admin Team accountability & turnaround - though open, accountability for decisions & roles could improve :) Further, responses to issues/requests sometimes takes some time or follow-ups before completed, and in times pending queries may be forgotten or overlooked. Though I understand admin has a lot on its plate, having better turnarounds would help management lead by example.

5) Career growth - SmartSourcing is a good stepping stone for me career-wise, however, due to nature of work, it may be difficult to sustain growth in the long-run as I am starting to feel stagnant.

Thank you SmartSourcing for the continued support! And looking forward to SmartSourcing continuously striving to get better."

6/3/2019 7:03:01,azel.a@startsmartsourcing.com,7,"7 because it is not all the time recommendable to my friends because of the qualifications. Smartsourcing has a high standard of qualifications when comes to hiring new people, so that means that I cannot easily recommend a friend especially when they have just good skills but specifically not good in communication skills and no work related experiences.

However, smartsourcing is so much recommendable to experienced people. "
6/3/2019 7:20:51,hazelle.v@startsmartsourcing.com,8,"Below are the reasons: 

- The ambiance of the place is a plus point to brag it to a friend.
- Free use of books and instruments 
- Monthly and Quarterly incentives to look forward
- Free Breakfast and Lunch!
- Very approachable admins"
6/3/2019 7:30:07,jerry.r@startsmartsourcing.com,9,The company provides something that the employees should look forward too. 
6/3/2019 7:48:25,rizzelle.m@startsmartsourcing.com,6,"The following contributes to the above score:
1. Work-life balance - I like that SS respects its employees' time after office hours or when employees are on VL/SL;
2. I can see that SS cares about its employees health and I appreciate that;
3. Free breakfast and lunch;
4. Admin team (Martin, Marky) is approachable and tries to resolve issues raised as quickly as possible;
5. Fun activities like movie nights and trivia nights; and,
6. I appreciate that the admin team (Ben) continues to look for possible fair performance incentives for the employees.

The following contributes to the remaining 4 points (room for improvement):
1. Job description - The job description per my contract and as discussed during the recruitment stage does not truly reflect the task I am actually doing on a daily basis. I feel like I am working as a clerk doing routine clerical tasks, it can make me feel stagnant when analytical skills are not being put to use. The fact that my trainee who is without an accounting background, can do some of my tasks when I'm away is very telling that this role may be filled by a non-CPA.

2. Hiring process - I am not sure if this was already improved but I hope that the hiring process would be more organized than before. I remember I was asked to come visit here for the 3rd or 4th time to sign the contract but the contract wasn't even finalized/printed by the time I arrived, all the way from Lapu-Lapu. 

3. Orientation - I remember I was only oriented with SS' VMOs. Policies and benefits were not discussed very clearly and after working here for a year, I still don't have a copy of the manual which contains the company's policies. Also, the tools to be used were not introduced. I was very confused when I was instructed to log into concierge or to file disputes (when I was in Melbourne) as if it was expected of me to know it. These minor issues could have been avoided had these been covered during the orientation. It is challenging to be proactive when you're not oriented on the subject matter in the first place.

4. Growth and Learning - As I mentioned above, I can feel stagnant because of the repetitive tasks which do not require much critical thinking. Due to this, it may be difficult to sustain professional growth and development.

Thank you for hearing our thoughts :)"
6/3/2019 8:38:54,katherine.n@startsmartsourcing.com,9,"Aside of the fun atmosphere, Smartsourcing is filled with passionate people."
6/3/2019 8:40:32,jacqline.f@startsmartsourcing.com,8,"8. Yes, in terms of perks and benefits, I believe Smartsourcing has given a good amount of effort in order to reach every employee's satisfaction peak. Given that the company is still young and aims to have positively skewed data on their graphs, it would be fair to give it more room for improvements. Thus, allowing it to experiment and make mistakes in the process. So yes, I would definitely recommend this company to those people that I find fit with the culture and its values. However, I won't recommend it to those people who are too rigid, dogmatic, self-righteous, and has a fixed mindset. Being able to practice fluidity amidst the chaos that change can bring is definitely a skill to learn and hone.

Responding to whether I'm satisfied as an employee is a different story. My satisfaction (and lack thereof) is subjective and therefore biased. It will not satisfactorily reflect how the company and the management is performing because my opinion differs from other employees. I can only testify and share my positive experiences. At the end of the day, it's up to the potential employee to decide if this company is worth his/her time and energy. Bottomline is, we all think and feel differently. I can't speak on behalf of others.

6/4/2019 8:06:36,jizzel.p@startsmartsourcing.com,4,"Here are the things that I appreciate of the Company:
1. Work-life balance - SS values and respects its employees' life after work (after office hours and when on leave). They won't let their employees be overworked instead they encourage work-life balance.   
2. Free lunch 
3. SS management looks for ways for their employees to have fun together such as having free movie, trivia nights, family day, etc. 
4. SS cares for the well being of its employees
5. IM team especially Marky and Martin are very responsive and understanding. They are easy to approach and are willing to help.
6. Management is open to feedback and ideas. The employees' opinions matter to them. They hear out the concerns of their employees through conducting this kind survey or having one on one meetings.

The areas that need improvement are the following:
1. Recruitment Process/Stage 
- The job description should be clear, properly established and consistent. From my experience, the job description posted on the website, stated in my contract and what I actually do are different.    
- The process is a bit lengthy (having multiple screening methods). 
- The qualifications should suit the job offered. I think most of the tasks that I am doing can be done by anyone who has an accounting background and not necessarily a CPA.
2. Orientation - There is no orientation on the tools that will be used. For example the use of freshdesk and how to dispute on Salarium.
3. Memo - It would be better if there is a company-wide discussion on the policies to be changed before it will be implemented. The employees should be given a copy of the memo issued and signed. 
4. Incentive/Bonus Program - For me, it would be better if there is differethe criteria for the incentives is not quite fair because the tasks differs from team to team. With this criteria, mostly same people are awarded every month.
5. Confidentiality of Information - Information should be kept confidential. I remembered that I have shared an issue with the admin regarding the concern of my one of my team and I was just surprised that the issue was spread. Because of this, others might be hesitant to air out their concerns.
6. Accountability - Management can lead by example by demonstrating proper accountability. For example, it would be best if the recent changes of policies were disseminated by the HR/management since this is a sensitive topic and the HR team are better equipped with the knowledge to answer the employees' concerns/clarifications/violent reactions.

Thank you! :) "
6/4/2019 8:12:04,edrian.s@startsmartsourcing.com,3,"-Admin team clearly lacks manpower to help and support all existing accounts.
-Low Compensation, I think the company should reappraise the salary they are giving out since they value High performance. 
-Bonus issues, I think the playing field should be leveled beforehand. Before we were hired, we were promised of bonuses so everyone should have equal chances of attaining it, not that we later find out that we are not yet eligible for bonuses because of some issues not resolved.
I know that the people who are running the company are smart and effective people, so I hope the issues above mentioned will be resolved soon."

6/4/2019 23:03:35,kaye@startsmartsourcing.com,5,"1.  It would really be appreciated if in case there would be major changes like change in policies regarding holidays or termination of a specific employee benefit, it would be communicated beforehand during a company-wide meeting where everyone has a chance to speak up or ask questions. It seems unjust to make everything ""effective immediately"" making employees feel powerless or as if our opinion doesn't matter at all.

2. Australian holidays will now be taken against VL credits. Whilst we understand this, VL credits should be increased for this very reason. Employees cannot spend all VL credits just to get paid for Australian holidays because there are also personal leaves we wish to have. Other BPO companies practice this too but the VL credits are sufficient enough to cover foreign holidays and personal leaves. 

3. There is no fixed de minimis benefit or monthly allowance. It is not required though, but in most, if not all, BPO companies, they are gratuitously giving such. It is very helpful for those employees who have families to feed especially that the salary here is really not competitive compared to other BPO companies. Here, you can't get monthly de minimis benefit automatically. An employee can only get an additional P500- P1,500 every month through attendance and performance bonus based on this ""productivity"" thing. If a team has clients who always give new tasks which makes them be on a ""training"" status forever, they can't get this bonus, unfortunately. Furthermore, the current monthly/quarterly performance bonus isn't really good because only the same people get rewards although everyone is exhausting their efforts to please their clients and produce a high-quality output.

4. No copy of the employment contract was given where normally this should be given during the job offer - only training contract was presented for signature but no copy was even given to the newly hired employee. Because of this, there is no written proof as to what compensation and benefits are due to an employee, list of company rules and the corresponding penalties upon violation (which makes it easy for the management to change the rules/benefits every now and then and make these changes effective immediately). With this, we also don't know what to expect should we choose to stay here for a couple of years more. Will our salary increase annually or will it remain the same even if we stay here until our hair turns gray? 

Overall, Smartsourcing doesn't seem to be a pro-employee company. Hopefully, the company will improve so that it will be the best choice for those who want a long-term employment. :-)"

I am so satisfied for what Smartsourcing has  done for their employees. The care, support and opportunities that they  give to their employees are much appreciated. That is why I Highly recommend this company to my friends and family."
6/5/2019 1:15:11,dexie.a@startsmartsourcing.com,10,People are approachable and friendly and the environment is good to work at.
6/5/2019 2:17:09,NorthEastSalesAssist@jelliscraig.com.au,8,"I am just a new employee here and I feel like this company is very family-oriented. I just hope you offer (SWAK - Bearbrand milk) for those who don't drink coffee for breakfast. But all in all, the best company so far! "

6/5/2019 2:21:10,jayson@startsmartsourcing.com,9,good working environment
6/5/2019 2:24:07,nishiell@startsmartsourcing.com,7,"It's good for people who are in need of a day shift job and weekends off, plus it offers free meals for everyone everyday. There's just some areas that still has to be improved especially with the management and/or supervision."
6/5/2019 2:25:43,cristopher.c@startsmartsourcing.com,5,"Pros 
* Good environment
* Free Lunch
* Cool People
* Chill
* The management and admin listens to you (sometimes)

Cons
* Bonuses needs work especially for our account
* Support
* KPI tracker for our account needs to improve
* Salary Appraisal"
6/5/2019 2:27:48,denise@startsmartsourcing.com,7,"Pros: The job that we do is great (especially since there's no calls involved). The workplace has a fun atmosphere. Subsidized gym.
Cons: The food isn't that great compared to before (normally wouldn't consider eating out but now the food served is no longer appetizing plus limited servings), payroll is confusing (used to a straight to the point payslip and not have to compute why pay is such always) "
6/5/2019 2:28:58,jerome@startsmartsourcing.com,9,it's the perfect place to work if you're looking for a balance between work and life. Only hitch for now I guess would be the lack of annual performance evaluation for possible salary increase.
6/5/2019 2:29:02,roxanne@startsmartsourcing.com,6,"Schedule wise is good most especially for people who no longer wants to work on Night shifts, at the same time there are perks that we enjoy like free lunch and breakfast. However, there are also things that needs to improve on like the strict implementation on Company policies and effective communication between admin and the agents. "
6/5/2019 2:30:00,she@startsmartsourcing.com,6,"Privilege of the employees were exercised (E.g Free breakfast, lunch & bonuses) which is good. Still, there are some aspects in the workplace that needs to be improved, not only on the technical side but also on the ethical, may it be leaders or rank and file employees."
6/5/2019 2:31:16,irene.g@startsmartsourcing.com,8,"I rated Smartsourcing according to my own opinion only! :) This is a growing company and everyone in management is trying their best to keep the rules in unbiased and they never let the employees be under compensated. The will always make a way to appreciate ones value. I think what they should improve is the justifiable reason and ample time for any company guidelines and rules. But all in all, I would absolutely share and promote Smartsourcing to all my friends and relatives! Kudos team and may God will continue to bless this family especially those people who are in administration & management. "
6/5/2019 2:32:02,rachel.v@startsmartsourcing.com,8,great things happen at SmartSourcing!
6/5/2019 2:35:38,ronan.a@startsmartsourcing.com,9,One of the best environment for work and growth.
6/5/2019 2:37:29,kathlene.s@startsmartsourcing.com,8,nice environment
6/5/2019 2:45:19,jericho.z@startsmartsourcing.com,7,There are still a lot of things to work on. Culture and Values must be uphold on all aspect. 
6/5/2019 2:47:27,annjing.s@startsmartsourcing.com,5,:)
6/5/2019 2:48:05,nicole.q@startsmartsourcing.com,8,"Thus far, Smartsourcing has the best environment plus there's a lot of privileges given to their employees.

However, there's not that much urgency applied on the concerns of their staff members and there's no career growth if you're profiled to an established account."
6/5/2019 2:48:14,roy.c@startsmartsourcing.com,9,It has this light and easy environment with supportive admins. Has amazingly friendly culture and assists career growth.
6/5/2019 2:49:02,bernel.a@startsmartsourcing.com,9,Smartsourcing is a company that promotes a culture of performance and strives to uphold both the welfare of the clients and the employees. 
6/5/2019 2:53:32,krisha.l@startsmartsourcing.com,8,Smartsourcing feels like home
6/5/2019 2:54:32,justine@startsmartsourcing.com,10,People are awesome! all are striving to grow in this industry TOGETHER!
6/5/2019 2:57:13,steven@startsmartsourcing.com,6,"As an individual with finance and taxation background, I am less likely to recommend to a friend or colleague to work here especially if he/she is aiming for career growth in financial reporting and related ares of expertise. There is so much to develop if Smartsourcing were to delve deeper to cater finance services to its clients. I believe there should be a separate department handling this kind of service. Currently, the scope is quite limited to process outsourcing i.e. administrative tasks. Others who are aiming for stability and work-life balance, I would greatly recommend Smartsourcing. 

To be fair, I appreciate Smartsoucing's perks as follows:
1. Free lunch
2. Quarterly Socials and other events (big budget)
3. Considerate and open-minded admin and management

Few concerns:
1. Inconsistent implementation of policy (eg. Holiday pay)
2. Diminution of incentives (eg. removal of reliability to staff) - this can be construed as a red flag on Company's people management aspect as there was no discussion or survey before it was implemented. Better if management have replaced a better scheme rather than removing an incentive at all. I'm also not convinced with the reason that it's being allocated to other rewards because the way I see it, the bonus program is not equitable for all.
3. Proper job matching and skillsets

6/5/2019 2:58:58,junrey.b@startsmartsourcing.com,10,This place is lit

6/5/2019 7:58:27,noemi@startsmartsourcing.com,9,"Because of our culture and how we value the employees.
"
6/5/2019 7:58:59,honey@startsmartsourcing.com,8,"This is a really good place to work if you're looking to up skill  yourself. However, I would wish that we hire people who are competent, even if they have trouble w English comms. It's not every day that you find someone passionate about a career and who would just want to learn.

In a perfect world, we'd be setting proper expectations for both clients and talent alike. "
6/5/2019 8:00:43,louie@startsmartsourcing.com,10,I believe this is the place where my friends can do a fresh start and get started should they choose to start a career being a virtual assistant.
6/5/2019 17:08:11,rosell.p@startsmartsourcing.com,8,"Better environment, good people, nice incentive"
6/5/2019 22:16:00,jemelita.g@startsmartsourcing.com,9,I choose this score because i highly recommend it to my friends as a good place to work.The management is continuously implementing system to help organise the communication between my coworkers to enhance our productivity.

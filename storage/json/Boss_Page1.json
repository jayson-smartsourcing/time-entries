As a part of the diary study, a participant will\nneed to set alerts for specified times during the day and be able to choose different alert options. When the participant\nis alerted, he or she needs to provide feedback that is relevant to the study. You will also need to design how the user is\nproviding feedback for the study.\nYou are allowed to add functionality or features that you feel would be beneficial to the user or help data collection for\nthe study.\nFor the sake of this exercise, it can be assumed that:\nthe application runs on Android OS, and\nthe user is familiar with the Android controls and gestures\nYou are tasked to design wireframes (or a prototype) for the application.\nThe focus of the app is its functionality and usability over graphics and visuals.\nTime Completed: 8hrs\nBefore I started designing this, I gathered as much information as I can to pinpoint the problem I'm solving and\ndetermine the participant's goals.

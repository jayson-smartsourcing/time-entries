With the learning that I took from that proud institution, I am very much certain that I possessed the qualities that your company is requiring.\nI had my internship at Phividec Industrial Authority which is a government entity. Particularly working on document filing, sorting, routing files and audio files transcribe. I had a working experience at Wilcon Depot, Inc. as a Product Consultant for 2 months. And also in Flexi Finance Asia in Cagayan de Oro City which is a financing company as a Sales Specialist for 2 years, working on data entry in creating client's application which is to be submitted for approval and introducing our products to the clients. Those experience had given me an opportunity to build confidence unto myself and towards dealing with other people which significantly prepared me to become a competent employee.\nThank you for taking time in reading my letter. I will be honored to come to your office for an interview. Requirements available upon request.\nRespectfully Yours,\nSHIELA MAE P.

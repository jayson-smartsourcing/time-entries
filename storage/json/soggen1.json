Ask:\nDo you live in a street, avenue, boulevard, road, court, crescent, drive, esplanade, square, grove,\netc.?\nIs your road\/street busy or quiet?\nWhat types of traffic do you see near where you live?\nCan we tell how busy\/quiet or safe\/dangerous a road is by its name or the number of lanes it has?\nBrainstorm the features of a road environment and list the ideas on the board. Clarify what these are as\nyou go. Encourage students to include the following: footpath, driveway, laneway, fence, road, road sign,\nroad marking, nature-strip, kerb, verge, pedestrian crossing, children's crossing, traffic lights, railway\ncrossing, median strip, roundabout, street vegetation (trees, shrubs), street furniture (bus shelters, post\nboxes, benches).\nAsk students to describe what traffic is.\nA suitable description would include:\nOn the road: cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles.\nOn paths: pedestrians, baby strollers, skateboarders, wheelchairs, motorised scooters.\nOn rails: trains, trams, light rail.\nIdentify and discuss the purpose of road signs and road markings.\nSigns and markings give information, warn about dangers, keep different vehicles and road users\nseparate (e.g. cars and pedestrians), and help keep all people using the roads safer when everyone obeys\nthem.\nDiscuss how signs can be sorted and have the class sort pictures of signs in different ways:\nShape, colour, size\nTraffic or non-traffic (e.g. animals crossing)\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n4\nRoad law (e.g. Stop) or warning (e.g. Slow down \u2013 Roadworks)\nThose with words, those that use symbols\nThose relating to drivers and those for pedestrians and cyclists.\nDiscuss what could happen if these signs and road markings were ignored. Identify other ways that road\nusers get messages about the roads, signs and signals (e.g. sounds from pedestrian signals, textured\npaint on the edges of roads to warn drivers, flashing hazard lights, road workers or police directing or\nslowing down traffic).\nBuild an understanding about the need to use our senses to keep us safe \u2013 look and listen.\nDiscuss how important it is to listen when in traffic.\nWhat do we listen for? (Parent instruction, vehicle noise, pedestrian signal beeps)\nWhy is it important to listen when in traffic?\nWhat does a busy street\/road sound like? What sounds can you hear?\nHow does a quiet street\/road sound? Are there still sounds in a quiet street?\nWhere does traffic come from? (Ensure students understand that it comes from all around)\nWhat do we need to look for?\nWhen can a quiet street become busy, and a busy street become quiet?\nCan both busy and quiet streets be dangerous? (Yes) What dangers are there with both kinds of\nstreets?\nExplore the concept of danger and introduce the concept of a road safety hazard.\nA danger is anything that interferes with our safety or puts us at risk of being hurt\/injured. Tell the class\nthat they will be looking for dangers when on a walk.\nDiscuss the concepts of fast, slow, near, far, towards, away from, busy and quiet.\nEXPLORING THE LOCAL AREA\nPreparation\nChoose an area in the school ground where you can mark out different widths of 'roads' using chalk or tape.\nOrganise adult helpers for the observation walk and ensure excursion protocols are followed. It may be useful\nto repeat an observational walk at a couple of different times in the day and have the class experience\ndifferent traffic volumes and behaviour.\nYou may like to take a camera on the observation walk to take photographs for later use in the classroom.\nMark out different widths of 'roads' in the school ground to practise crossings.\nDiscuss the concepts of 'wide' and 'narrow' and different types of roads. Ask:\nHow can you tell if the road is wide or narrow? (One lane, many lanes)\nIf a road is wide, will it take more time to cross than if it is narrow?\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n5\nIndividually in turn, or in small groups, have the students cross the 'roads' that are marked out. Other\nstudents should observe and could count the steps they need and even the time it takes to cross.\nTalk about what crossing time and road widths mean for safety.\nPlan to go on a group walk around your local area.\nExplain the group walk procedure and practise this on the way to the school gate (see Safe Walking\nProcedures in Book 1).\nGive clear instructions such as: \"Walk to the \u2026 and stop.\" Explain why it is important to stop when told.\nBeing small, children can't always see traffic and not all drivers can see them.\nChildren are not always aware of what is dangerous and where that danger is coming from.\nGo on a group walk.\nStop along the way at suitable locations and spend about 10 minutes each time observing and discussing\nwhat they can see:\nObserve the types of vehicles using the roads.\nNote and discuss road and footpath features.\nLook for anything that could be a hazard.\nHave the students count how many vehicles travel past them during one minute.\nDiscuss the volume of traffic:\nIs the road busy or quiet? What makes it busy or quiet? (Relate this back to the number of\nvehicles they counted in one minute.)\nWhich vehicles are coming toward us and which are going away from us? How can we tell?\nWhich vehicles are going fast and which are going slow? How do we know?\nWhen vehicles are going fast, do they get to us sooner than those that go slower?\nObserve signs and road markings:\nWhat do the signs and road markings direct people to do?\nWho are the signs and road markings for? (e.g. pedestrians, cyclists or drivers)\nWhere are they located and why might they be here?\nDiscuss the shape, colour, words and numbers on the road signs and markings.\nAs you walk, look out for driveways.\nAsk and discuss:\nHow can pedestrians tell if a vehicle is coming out of the driveway? (e.g. listen for sounds, look\nfor clues such as exhaust emissions, reversing lights or beeps from trucks)\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n6\nIntroduce the concept of the time it takes to cross a road.\nIf there are pedestrians visible, observe how long it takes them to cross roads and if possible count the\nnumber of steps it takes.\nIf there is a signalised crossing, count out how long the green man signal stays on. Note this information,\nand you could have the class rehearse road crossings in the school ground later and see if they can cross\nthis width of a road in the allocated time \u2013 walking not running.\nStop on a straight stretch of road away from any cross roads (mid-block) and have the class pick out a\nvehicle in the distance and decide when it would be safe to cross, if they were with an adult. They should\ntake into account the time it takes to cross the road, as well as the speed of the vehicle and the time\nuntil it arrives. Focus on the Look part of the Stop, Look, Listen, Think procedure and ask them to tell you\nwhere other vehicles are while they are looking at their chosen vehicle.\nBACK IN THE CLASSROOM\nPreparation\nIf not done earlier, download and either display or print off pictures of traffic signs available from the VicRoads\nwebsite\n(www.vicroads.vic.gov.au\/Home\/SafetyAndRules\/RoadSafetyEducation\/PrimarySchools\/CorePrimarySchoolRes\nource.htm).\nRemind students about the concept of hazard, and ask them to think of examples they have\nseen.\nList these examples of hazards on the board, such as:\nVehicles travelling towards them or in the same direction.\nThings that restrict\/limit vision \u2013 such as parked cars, plants on the sides of roads.\nThe roadway itself \u2013 may be partly concealed by a bend or curve, hills, hard to see corners.\nThings on the footpath that cause you to leave the footpath \u2013 people riding bikes, scooters, pot\nholes, cars parked across footpaths.\nThings a pedestrian might do \u2013 such as not concentrating, playing with a ball, showing off, not\nwanting to use the Stop, Look, Listen, Think procedure, not thinking safely, running across\ndriveways\/laneways.\nIn rural areas there may be no footpaths so people need to walk along the side of the road, facing\noncoming traffic.\nOrganise the class into small groups and allocate them a road safety hazard that was\nidentified in the local area.\nEach group should discuss what they could do to manage the hazard and then report back to the class.\nAs a class decide if each proposed strategy is a safe\/unsafe way to manage the danger. For example:\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n7\nIf the hazard was a group of shrubs obstructing the view of the road, you could manage this by\nmoving along the footpath to a place where you had a clear view in all directions before crossing\nthe road.\nIn rural areas with no footpaths you should walk on the side of the road facing oncoming traffic,\nand walk with no more than two people side by side.\nHave the class draw some of the dangers they need to be aware of when they are walking.\nWrite sentences or stories about narrow and wide roads, busy and quiet roads.\nEmphasise the importance of holding hands when near traffic.\nDiscuss why it is important to hold hands with an adult when you are near traffic \u2013 e.g. an adult is taller\nand has a better view of traffic, is more familiar with road rules and where danger may come from.\nAsk:\nWhat else could you hold onto when an adult's hands are full? (e.g. when carrying shopping\nbags, hold onto one of the bags)\nWhen can it be okay to let go of an adult's hand? (e.g. when the crossing task is safely completed\nand you are walking on the footpath, when you are older and have had lots of practise)\nHave students design and produce a frieze of the signs and signals in the local area.\nDraw on their experiences of the local area during the group walk. Use pictures of signs and road\nmarkings to stimulate their thinking. Add to the frieze over time as they discover more.\nUse the signs and road markings in the frieze as a starting point to encourage story writing about a trip\nthey have made, identifying what was safe (or unsafe) about the trip. If they cannot think of a trip they\nhave made themselves, they could think of an instance where they observed others doing safe or unsafe\nthings related to road signs, signals or rules.\nAT HOME\nPreparation\nPut the Module 1 - Information for parents\/carers into the school newsletter to help parents understand how\nto cross roads safely with their children.\nMake copies of Module 1 - Take Home Activities 1 and 2 for the class.\nDistribute Take Home Activity 1: My street record sheet.\nExplain to students that they are to talk to their parents\/carers about the ways to stay safe when they\nare walking and then complete the activity.\nDistribute Take Home Activity 2: Signs in my neighbourhood.\nAsk students to go on a walk around their local area with their parents\/carers and take note of any signs\nand signals they observe. Tell them to fill in the activity sheet as they go, and discuss with their\nparent\/carer what the signs and signals mean and who they are for.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n8\nACTIVITY: Vehicles\nIN THE CLASSROOM\nBrainstorm and list different types of vehicles.\nFor the purposes of this activity, a vehicle is defined as any form of transport with wheels. Traffic is\ndefined as the coming and going of vehicles and people.\nExplain how there are many different types of vehicles on and near roads, and they must look out for\nthem as they come from every direction, and not just from the right or left.\nOn the board list the different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, vans, trains, trams, bicycles,\nmotorcycles). Quickly sort and classify the vehicles by size in real life, use, whether they carry passengers\nor goods, whether they are on tracks or roads.\nAsk about which vehicles are better for the environment and why (e.g. bicycles because they have no\nemissions, public transport vehicles because they can move large numbers of people in a more energy\nefficient way than individual modes of transport like cars or motorcycles).\nDiscuss which types of vehicles are seen travelling in your local area, and indicate these on the list.\nFor rural areas, talk about how some types of vehicles can be seasonal (e.g. grain trucks) or regular daily\noccurrences (e.g. milk tankers, school buses) and how other traffic can appear at any time.\nDetermine which parts of a vehicle are important for the safety of those inside the vehicle and\nthose outside the vehicle.\nExplain how vehicles have safety features which are designed to keep all road users safer.\nBrainstorm a list of vehicle safety features on the board, e.g.\nInside: restraints\/seat belts, door locks, air bags, handrails.\nOutside: headlights, reversing lights, indicators, brakes, hazard lights, mirrors, audible reverse\nsignal (mainly in commercial vehicles).\nAsk and discuss how each of these features help make road users safe.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n9\nEXPLORING THE LOCAL AREA\nPreparation\nInvite a parent or staff member to assist you with this activity. You will need their car and a child booster seat\n(ensure you use one with a back on it). It may be necessary to organise several seats and parent helpers with\nthis activity to ensure all children have a turn if time is limited.\nMake sure the students bring along the vehicle tally sheets they made in class.\nObserve the safety features of a vehicle.\nHave the parent park their vehicle in the school grounds or somewhere else where it is safe for the class\nto be able to see the car being driven slowly. Position the class safely so they can all see the vehicle.\nAsk:\nWhat safety features can you see on the vehicle? Have the helper use the various lights,\nincluding indicators and reversing lights.\nWhat does it mean when you see these various safety features working when you are a\npedestrian or a passenger?\nBuild an understanding about near and far, fast and slow, towards and away.\nHave the helper drive the vehicle some distance away but still in sight. Ask:\nIs the vehicle the same size as when it is up close to us? (Yes, it just appears smaller.)\nHave the driver drive slowly toward the class.\nDiscuss what happens to the vehicle's size as it gets closer.\nDiscuss the concept of speed:\nHow can you tell if a vehicle coming towards you is travelling slow or fast? (Point out that you\ncan't if you are an inexperienced road user, so don't cross the road unless the adult you are with\nsays it is safe to do so.)\nIf possible, get a second adult helper to do the same exercise on a bicycle (make sure a helmet is worn).\nAsk:\nAre the car and the bike coming towards you at the same speed?\nHow can you tell?\nAsk the helper in the vehicle to demonstrate some simple vehicle movements, such as reversing, turning\nleft and right, and stopping.\nInvite the class to discuss what they can see and what each of these vehicle movements might mean for\nthem in terms of safety.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n10\nCan the driver always see them?\nCan they always see the driver?\nWhy is it important to be seen?\/PrimarySchools\/CorePrimarySchoolRes\nource.htm).\nRemind students about the concept of hazard, and ask them to think of examples they have\nseen.\nList these examples of hazards on the board, such as:\nVehicles travelling towards them or in the same direction.\nThings that restrict\/limit vision \u2013 such as parked cars, plants on the sides of roads.\nThe roadway itself \u2013 may be partly concealed by a bend or curve, hills, hard to see corners.\nThings on the footpath that cause you to leave the footpath \u2013 people riding bikes, scooters, pot\nholes, cars parked across footpaths.\nThings a pedestrian might do \u2013 such as not concentrating, playing with a ball, showing off, not\nwanting to use the Stop, Look, Listen, Think procedure, not thinking safely, running across\ndriveways\/laneways.\nIn rural areas there may be no footpaths so people need to walk along the side of the road, facing\noncoming traffic.\nOrganise the class into small groups and allocate them a road safety hazard that was\nidentified in the local area.\nEach group should discuss what they could do to manage the hazard and then report back to the class.\nAs a class decide if each proposed strategy is a safe\/unsafe way to manage the danger.

Traffic is\ndefined as the coming and going of vehicles and people.\nExplain how there are many different types of vehicles on and near roads, and they must look out for\nthem as they come from every direction, and not just from the right or left.\nOn the board list the different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, vans, trains, trams, bicycles,\nmotorcycles). Quickly sort and classify the vehicles by size in real life, use, whether they carry passengers\nor goods, whether they are on tracks or roads.\nAsk about which vehicles are better for the environment and why (e.g. bicycles because they have no\nemissions, public transport vehicles because they can move large numbers of people in a more energy\nefficient way than individual modes of transport like cars or motorcycles).\nDiscuss which types of vehicles are seen travelling in your local area, and indicate these on the list.\nFor rural areas, talk about how some types of vehicles can be seasonal (e.g. grain trucks) or regular daily\noccurrences (e.g. milk tankers, school buses) and how other traffic can appear at any time.\nDetermine which parts of a vehicle are important for the safety of those inside the vehicle and\nthose outside the vehicle.\nExplain how vehicles have safety features which are designed to keep all road users safer.\nBrainstorm a list of vehicle safety features on the board, e.g.\nInside: restraints\/seat belts, door locks, air bags, handrails.\nOutside: headlights, reversing lights, indicators, brakes, hazard lights, mirrors, audible reverse\nsignal (mainly in commercial vehicles).\nAsk and discuss how each of these features help make road users safe.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n9\nEXPLORING THE LOCAL AREA\nPreparation\nInvite a parent or staff member to assist you with this activity. You will need their car and a child booster seat\n(ensure you use one with a back on it). It may be necessary to organise several seats and parent helpers with\nthis activity to ensure all children have a turn if time is limited.\nMake sure the students bring along the vehicle tally sheets they made in class.\nObserve the safety features of a vehicle.\nHave the parent park their vehicle in the school grounds or somewhere else where it is safe for the class\nto be able to see the car being driven slowly. Position the class safely so they can all see the vehicle.\nAsk:\nWhat safety features can you see on the vehicle? Have the helper use the various lights,\nincluding indicators and reversing lights.\nWhat does it mean when you see these various safety features working when you are a\npedestrian or a passenger?\nBuild an understanding about near and far, fast and slow, towards and away.\nHave the helper drive the vehicle some distance away but still in sight. Ask:\nIs the vehicle the same size as when it is up close to us? (Yes, it just appears smaller.)\nHave the driver drive slowly toward the class.\nDiscuss what happens to the vehicle's size as it gets closer.\nDiscuss the concept of speed:\nHow can you tell if a vehicle coming towards you is travelling slow or fast? (Point out that you\ncan't if you are an inexperienced road user, so don't cross the road unless the adult you are with\nsays it is safe to do so.)\nIf possible, get a second adult helper to do the same exercise on a bicycle (make sure a helmet is worn).\nAsk:\nAre the car and the bike coming towards you at the same speed?\nHow can you tell?\nAsk the helper in the vehicle to demonstrate some simple vehicle movements, such as reversing, turning\nleft and right, and stopping.\nInvite the class to discuss what they can see and what each of these vehicle movements might mean for\nthem in terms of safety.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n10\nCan the driver always see them?\nCan they always see the driver?\nWhy is it important to be seen?\/\nNewRoadSafetyEducationInitiatives\/StorybooksAndApps.htm\nCreate a simple model of the local area around the school based on student observations. Include\nroads of different widths and with different features, such as traffic calming devices (e.g. speed\nhumps), median strips, traffic lights. Use colour coded symbols to mark particularly dangerous areas.\nHave children bring different miniature vehicles from home to use with the model. Classify these\nvehicles according to the type and whether there is a particular part of the roadway they must use.\nIn conjunction with the LOTE teacher, reinforce the learnings about traffic signs, signals and markings\nby identifying, discussing and making road signs, signals, markings and road safety messages in\ndifferent languages.\nActivity: Vehicles\nTeaming up with students in older grades, the class could do some 'research' about vehicles in the\npast.\no What safety features were included?\no What designs were evident?\no How have safety features in vehicles changed over time?\nThey could use the library, the internet or interview older people. Once they have conducted their\nresearch they could design a really safe futuristic vehicle.\nInvite the local police to come to the school with a speed detector device. Have them work with the\nchildren to check the speed of passing vehicles, and to talk about fast and slow. The police could also\nspeak about the importance of their parent\/carer travelling at or below the speed limit.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n19\nAllocate small groups of students to different forms of travel \u2013 pedestrian, bicyclist, passenger in a\ncar and passenger on a bus or train (if appropriate). Have them:\no Devise rules for each type of road user.\no Identify any signs and road markings that relate to a particular type of road user and help\nthem to be safer.\no Discuss and design a piece of equipment (actual or fantasy) that could keep each road user\nsafer.\nFor students in rural locations, have them identify different types of travel (e.g. farm bikes, quad\nbikes, utilities, tractors, headers) and:\no Identify what makes these vehicles safe or unsafe\no Devise some rules about travelling in off road vehicles.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n20\nLIST OF KEY ROAD SAFETY TERMS\nCasualty \u2013 fatality or serious injury resulting from a road crash\nChildren's crossing \u2013 a crossing near a school that is active only when the flags are displayed\nCrash \u2013 a violent collision causing harm or damage\nDistraction \u2013 something that reduces concentration and attention\nFatality \u2013 a death as a result of a crash\nFootpath \u2013 a narrow path for a person on foot\nForce \u2013 the acceleration of a body in the direction of its application\nFriction \u2013 the force generated between two surfaces when they rub or move over each other\nGreenhouse gases - any of the atmospheric gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect\nHazard \u2013 something in the traffic or road environment that could cause risk or harm\nIntersection \u2013 a place where two or more roads meet\nKerb \u2013 raised concrete lip at the edge of the roadway\nMid-block \u2013 the section of road between two intersections\nPedestrian \u2013 a person travelling on foot\nPedestrian crossing \u2013 a designated point in the road where there is a means to assist walkers to cross,\nsuch as traffic signals or warning signs\nPublic transport \u2013 trains, trams or buses, including school buses\nRestraints \u2013 seatbelts and similar devices designed to keep people from being thrown around in a vehicle\nduring a crash or when braking suddenly\nRoad \u2013 a public way for road users\nRoad markings \u2013 lines and markings on the road to guide traffic and road users\nRoad trauma \u2013 the serious injury or shock to the body as a result of a collision or crash\nSafety door \u2013 the left side (kerbside) rear door of a car\nSerious injury \u2013 an injury that requires a person to be taken to hospital\nShared pathway \u2013 a path where people travelling by different modes can travel together, such as\npedestrians and cyclists\nSpeed \u2013 the distance travelled divided by the time it takes\nStop, Look, Listen, Think \u2013 a systematic procedure designed for pedestrians to use when crossing roads\nand railway lines\nStopping distance \u2013 the total distance that a vehicle travels to come to a stop once the driver realises\nthat the vehicle has to stop\nTravel mode \u2013 different ways of travelling, e.g. walking, riding, driving, public transport\nTraffic signals\/signs \u2013 a light, sign or other signal used to control or manage traffic or to provide\ninformation to road users\nVerge \u2013 the extreme edge of the road\nVehicle \u2013 a device for transporting persons or things, such as a car, train, tram, bus, motorcycle or\nbicycle.\nZebra crossing \u2013 a pedestrian crossing with painted thick white lines on the road, usually with 'walking\nlegs' signs and sometimes amber flashing lights.\nMODULE 1: Roads, Vehicles and Traffic\n21\nUSEFUL WEBSITES\nRoad Safety Education Victoria - www.roadsafetyeducation.vic.gov.au\nRoad Safety Victoria - www.roadsafety.vic.gov.au\nTransport Accident Commission (TAC) - www.tac.vic.gov.au\nVicRoads - www.vicroads.vic.gov.au\nVictoria Police - www.police.vic.gov.au\nDEECD - www.education.vic.gov.au\/school\/teachers\/health\/Pages\/trafficsafety.aspx\nRACV - www.racv.com.au\nPublic Transport Victoria - www.ptv.vic.gov.au\/about-ptv\/education\nKidsafe - www.kidsafe.com.au\nAustralian Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development - www.infrastructure.gov.au\/\nNewRoadSafetyEducationInitiatives\/StorybooksAndApps.htm\nCreate a simple model of the local area around the school based on student observations.
